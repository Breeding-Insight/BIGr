\usage{
check_ped(ped.file)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped.file}{path to pedigree text file. The pedigree file is a
3-column pedigree tab separated file with columns labeled as id sire dam in any order}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes of error types, and the output printed to the console
}
\description{
Check a pedigree file for accuracy and output suspected errors
}
\details{
check_ped takes a 3-column pedigree tab separated file with columns labeled as id sire dam in any order and checks for:
\itemize{
\item Ids that appear more than once in the id column
\item Ids that appear in both sire and dam columns
\item Direct (e.g. parent is a offspring of his own daughter) and indirect (e.g. a great grandparent is son of its granchild) dependencies within the pedigree.
\item Individuals included in the pedigree as sire or dam but not on the id column and reports them back with unknown parents (0).
}

When using check_ped, do a first run to check for repeated ids and parents that appear as sire and dam.
Once these errors are cleaned run the function again to check for dependencies as this will provide the most accurate report.

Note: This function does not change the input file but prints any errors found in the console.

\examples{
##Get list with a dataframe for each error type
#ped_errors <- check_ped(ped.file = "example_ped.txt")

##Access the "messy parents" dataframe result
#ped_errors$messy_parents

##Get list of sample IDs with messy parents error
#messy_parent_ids <- ped_errors$messy_parents$id
#print(messy_parent_ids)
}
