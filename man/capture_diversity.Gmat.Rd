\title{Estimate Minimum Number of Individuals to Sample to Capture Population Genomic Diversity (Genotype Matrix)}
\usage{
capture_diversity.Gmat(
  df,
  ploidy,
  r2_threshold = 0.9,
  iterations = 10,
  sample_list = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  batch = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Genotype matrix or data.frame with the count of alternate alleles (0=homozygous reference, 1 = heterozygous, 2 = homozygous alternate)}

\item{ploidy}{The ploidy of the species being analyzed}

\item{r2_threshold}{The ratio of diversity to capture (default = 0.9)}

\item{iterations}{The number of iterations to perform to estimate the average result (default = 10)}

\item{sample_list}{The list of samples to subset from the dataset (optional)}

\item{parallel}{Run the analysis in parallel (True/False) (default = FALSE)}

\item{save.result}{Save the results to a .txt file? (default = TRUE)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with minimum number of samples required to match or exceed the input ratio
}
\description{
This function can be used to estimate the number of individuals to sample from a population
in order to capture a desired percentage of the genomic diversity.
It assumes that the samples are the columns, and the genomic markers are in rows. Missing data should
be set as NA, which will then be ignored for the calculations. All samples must have the same ploidy.
This function was adapted from a previously developed Python method (Sandercock et al., 2023)
(https://github.com/alex-sandercock/Capturing_genomic_diversity/)
