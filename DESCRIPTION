Description: This package contains the functions developed within Breeding
    Insight to analyze diploid and polyploid breeding and genetic data. 'BIGr' 
    provides the ability to filter VCF files, extract SNPs from the DArT MADC file, 
    and manipulate genotype data for both diploid and polyploid species. It also serves 
    as the core dependency for the 'BIGapp' Shiny app, which provides a user-friendly interface for performing
    routine genotype analysis tasks such as dosage calling, filtering, PCA, GWAS, and Genomic Prediction.
