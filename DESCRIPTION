Description: Functions developed within Breeding Insight to analyze
    diploid and polyploid breeding and genetic data. 'BIGr' provides the
    ability to filter VCF files, extract SNPs from the DArT MADC file, and
    manipulate genotype data for both diploid and polyploid species. It
    also serves as the core dependency for the 'BIGapp' Shiny app, which
    provides a user-friendly interface for performing routine genotype
    analysis tasks such as dosage calling, filtering, PCA, GWAS, and
    Genomic Prediction.
