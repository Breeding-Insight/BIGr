\title{Switch Dosage Values from a Genotype Matrix}
\usage{
flip_dosage(df, ploidy, is.reference = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Genotype matrix or data.frame}

\item{ploidy}{The ploidy of the species being analyzed}

\item{is.reference}{The dosage calls value is based on the count of reference alleles (TRUE/FALSE)}
}
\value{
A genotype matrix
}
\description{
This function converts the dosage count values to the opposite value. This is primarily used when converting
dosage values from reference based (0 = homozygous reference) to alternate count based (0 = homozygous alternate).
It assumes that the Samples are the columns, and the genomic markers are in rows. Missing data should
be set as NA, which will then be ignored for the calculations. All samples must have the same ploidy.
